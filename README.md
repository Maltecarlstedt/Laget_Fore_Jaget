To run this project the project structure need to be configured. These libraries can be find in the projects library folder. The libraries that need to be added to the project structure are: 

1. $Root/libraries/slick.jar

Please contact anyone in the group if you cant run it.

# The project

This is a object oriented project created for the course TDA367 at Chalmers University of Technology. The purpose of the project was to create a game or application with as much object oriented skills as possible. This include following the SOLID principles aswell as using the MVC design pattern for our code. The other half of the project was to be able to work as a group in a software development project. This include using techniques such as sprints, git, user stories, git issues etc to make our project come to life. We also had to create a SDD and RAD for our project. The project was very successfull and we are very happy with the outcome.
